          <p class="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Spenser! I am a full-stack web developer and live in Boise, Idaho.  I began coding back in highschool, making text-based adventure games on my Ti-83 Calculator.  After taking all of the computer classes my high-school offered, I became the Teaching Assistant for the A/V class.  This led to me becoming an Executive Producer of Tribe Talk, my school's news program.  I will always have a passion for video games, which started back when I was about 5 or 6, with Pokemon Blue Version on the original Gameboy.  I've since graduated from hand-helds and consoles to play games exclusively on PC.  The games I play currently are Runescape, League of Legends, Diablo 3, Minecraft, and Civilization V.  I also love music and can play the ukulele, guitar, and piano.  I am self-taught on all 3, so I'm not a professional, but its fun!  My favorite artists are lil peep, guardin, guccihighwaters, aries, grandson, sadeyes, the 1975, and blackbear. My favorite movies are Interstellar, The Goonies, and any of the movies from the Lord of the Rings / The Hobbit trilogies.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April of 2020, I began attending Boise CodeWorks, a 13 week web development bootcamp, where I learned to use multiple programming languages and frameworks to solve real-world problems through the use of web applications.  As a part of the cirriculum I built a small static page with bootstrap, a todo list, a browser home page with random pictures and quotes from an API, a clicking game like Cookie Clicker, a bug log, a kanban-style board application for tracking project progress, a pintrest clone, several different versions of a craigslist type application, several console applications with C#, and many more.  Over the 13 weeks I learned how to use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node.js, MongoDB + Mongoose, Vue.js, C#, MySQL, Trello, Git, Github, and Figma.  I successfully graduated the course on July 31st of 2020, and have not stopped learning since.  Below you will find periodic posts about different technologies I am learning!  Thank you for visiting!</p>

          <h4 class=" text-left pb-2">The MERN stack consists of 4 main technologies:</h4>
          <div class="row mx-2 text-left pb-2">
            <p><b>M</b> - MongoDB - a noSQL database that uses JSON-style documents to store data from an application</p>
            <p><b>E</b> - Express - a node.js framework that offers robust routing, http helpers, content negotiation, and much more</p>
            <p><b>R</b> - React   - a front-end component-based javascript framework for creating powerful interactive UIs</p>
            <p><b>N</b> - Node.js - a javascript back-end language that helps with generating dynamic page content</p>

          </div>
          <p class="text-left border-top border-dark pt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To learn the MERN stack, I developed an application called CookBook, which allows a user to create recipes, browse recipes, and favorite recipes.  The application also features a built-in calculator for converting common units of volume, such as teaspoons, tablespoons, cups, pints, quarts, and gallons.  There is also a larger page containing a chart with other common cooking conversions.  The application is hosted on Heroku.  <a href="https://mycookbook-2020.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" class="">Click to demo</a></p>

          <p class=" text-left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep myself practiced in Vue and C# / mySQL, I built out a simple banking application, called RealBank.  This application had a few challenges, mostly with transfering funds, but once I got past them it didn't take to long to finish off.  Users can edit transactions if they accidentally input a wrong amount or category, users can delete transactions (except for transfers), and users can transfer funds between accounts, which automatically creates two separate transactions.  Accounts can also be closed, which acts as a transfer between the account you close and the account you move the money into, but then the account you are closing gets removed from the database.  To view a demo video or use the application, navigate back to my portfolio page. The application uses Vue.js and boostrap on the front-end and uses C# and mySQL on the back.  The application is hosted through a docker image on Heroku</p>

          <p class=" text-left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After graduating from Codeworks I kind of didn't know what to do with myself.  I had a job prospect that had to do with Salesforce, so I decided to start learning.  Over several weeks of doing learning modules in my down-time, I gained 36 badges across topics like UX/UI design, development stategies, data modeling, and creating reports and dashboards for salesforce applications.  While completing these badges I earned a total of 24,800 points and the rank of Mountaineer.  I also managed to complete the Business Administration Specialist Superbadge on August 20th, which was quite an accomplishment for me.  You can follow the link below to visit my profile.</p>
